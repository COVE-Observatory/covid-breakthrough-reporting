Dear TARGET:
 
My colleagues and I are using public data on Covid infections among the vaccinated and unvaccinated/partially vaccinated during the past few months to investigate vaccine effectiveness for the Delta variant. Our results, reported in the following MedRxiv submission, are encouraging.
 
https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.18.21263783v1
 
We would very much like to include data from STATE in this analysis.
 
Specifically, we are looking for number of reported infections among (a) vaccinated and (b) unvaccinated or partially vaccinated, ideally on a weekly or more frequent basis, and over as long a time period as is possible.
 
We very much hope that you can help. It looks so far like our results correct some misconceptions about the effectiveness of vaccines against the Delta variant, so it’s in a good cause.
 
Regards – PERSON
